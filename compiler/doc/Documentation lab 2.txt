I modified the javalette.cf and typechecker.hs from lab1 to "annotate" 
statements with an int, telling you if it guarantees a return statement (1+)
or not (0). In javalette.cf I added the constructor(?) "Retting Stmt Integer"
and in Typechecker.hs I simply removed the Bool return value in checkStm
and made sure to use the annotated statements instead. 

The reason this change was necessary was to be able to "optimize" when 
generating LLVM code; if a statements guarantees a return statement
we can omit generating any of the subsequent code.
